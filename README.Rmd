<!-- badges: end -->

`phsopendata` contains functions to interact with open data from the [Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data platform](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/) via the CKAN API. 

- `get-resource` extracts a single resource from an open dataset by resource id
- `get-dataset` extracts multiple resources from an open dataset by dataset name

For extracting metadata and search functionality, we recommend using the [ckanr package](https://docs.ropensci.org/ckanr/). 

`phsopendata` can be used on both the [server](https://rstudio.nhsnss.scot.nhs.uk/) and desktop versions of RStudio. However, depending on firewall settings, proxy use may need to be configured with `use_proxy()`.

## Installation

You need to install `phsopendata` from GitHub, which requires a package like `remotes` or `devtools`.

Using `remotes` you run this to install the package:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Public-Health-Scotland/phsopendata",
  upgrade = "never"
)
```

## Examples

### Downloading a data table with `get_resource()`

To extract a specific resource, you will need it's unique identifier - resource id. This can be found in the dataset metadata, the URL of a resource's page on https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/, or extracted using `ckanr::package_show`.

```{r example resource, eval = FALSE}
library(phsopendata)

# define a resource ID
res_id <- "a794d603-95ab-4309-8c92-b48970478c14"

# download the data from the CKAN database
data <- get_resource(res_id = "a794d603-95ab-4309-8c92-b48970478c14")
```

### Querying/filtering data with `get_resource()`
You can define a row limit with the `rows` argument to get the first *N* rows of a table.
```{r example row, eval = FALSE}
# get first 100 rows
get_resource(
  res_id = "a794d603-95ab-4309-8c92-b48970478c14",
  rows = 100
)
```

You can use `col_select` and `row_filters` to query the data server-side (i.e., the data is filtered before it is downloaded to your machine).
```{r example query, eval = FALSE}
# get first 100 rows
get_resource(
  res_id = "a794d603-95ab-4309-8c92-b48970478c14",
  col_select = c("GPPracticeName", "TelephoneNumber"),
  row_filters = list(
    HB = "S08000017",
    Dispensing = "Y"
  )
)
```

### Downloading multiple tables with `get_dataset()`

To extract all resources from a dataset, you will need to use the *dataset name*. Note that this will differ from the *dataset title* that displays on the website. This can be found in the dataset metadata extracted using `ckanr::package_show`, or taken from the dataset URL. 

In this example, we are downloading GP Practice Population Demographics from: [opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/*gp-practice-populations*](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-populations), so the dataset name will be gp-practice-populations.


```{r example dataset, eval = FALSE}
# if max_resources is not set, all resources will be returned by default. 
# Here we pull 10 rows from the first 2 resources only
get_dataset("gp-practice-populations", max_resources = 2, rows = 10)
```
